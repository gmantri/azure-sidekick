  Grounding Rules:

  The user has asked a question that may not be clear in its current form and may rely on the context of multiple 
  previous questions and answers. Your task is to rephrase or reword the question, taking into account the conversation history if available, 
  to improve its clarity for a Language Model (LLM) to answer it.
  
  Conversation History:
  ====================
  {{#each chat_history}}
  Question: {{OriginalQuestion}}
  Answer: {{Question}}
  {{/each}}
  </message>
  
  Current Question:
  =================
  <message role="user">{{question}}</message>
  
  <message role="system">
  Considering the information provided to you, please rephrase or reword the current question to increase its clarity and 
  specificity for a language model. Consider identifying the key elements or concepts within the question, ensuring the 
  language is precise, and avoiding any ambiguity or overly complex language. Remember to incorporate the context provided 
  by the previous questions and answers. Your goal is to create a revised question that maintains the original intent, 
  but is more easily understood by an LLM when considering the conversation history.
